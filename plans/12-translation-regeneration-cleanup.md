### In-Depth Description

**Functional Increment**  
- Implement the "Translate" feature (creating a new project with translated slides).  
- Provide a "Re-Generate Video" action if slides change.  
- Allow deletion of projects and associated files.

**Objects / Components**  
- **Translation Flow**:  
  - `POST /api/projects/{id}/translate?lang=XX` calls OpenAI to translate all slides and creates a new `VideoProject`.  
- **Re-Generate**:  
  - If narration changes, allow users to re-trigger the entire TTS/video generation.  
- **Delete**:  
  - `DELETE /api/projects/{id}` with an option to remove files from storage or mark them as deleted.

**Testing Criteria**  
1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Mock translation calls to verify a new project with new slides is created.  
   - Re-Generation logic to ensure it overwrites or re-creates the final video.  
   - Deletion logic to ensure the project and slides are removed or flagged.  
2. **E2E Tests**  
   - Translate a project → verify a new project ID is created with all slides in the new language.  
   - Modify narration → re-generate the video → confirm an updated video is generated.  
   - Delete a project → confirm it's removed from the list and no longer accessible via API.

**Instruction: Next Step**  
- Step 12 concludes the core functionality. Any further enhancements or refinements will follow in additional steps or future sprints.
