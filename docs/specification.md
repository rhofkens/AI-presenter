## 1. Introduction

This PRD describes the **functional requirements** for a web application that converts a PowerPoint presentation into an entertaining video with AI-narrated voiceovers and smooth slide transitions. The application leverages AI to create a coherent, fluent story from the slide content. Non-functional requirements are also listed at a high level; detailed technical and infrastructure specifications will be defined in a separate Architecture Document.

### 1.1 Goal

The main goal is to enable users to:
- Upload a PowerPoint (PPT) file.
- Automatically parse and transform the PPT content into an AI-generated video.
- Allow user-driven editing of slide images, text narratives, and overall metadata (title, description).
- Generate a final narrated video using an AI avatar service.

### 1.2 Key Objectives

- **Automate** the process of converting slide decks to videos.
- **Enhance** user engagement through natural and fluent AI narrations.
- **Simplify** user workflows with minimal manual intervention.
- **Provide** options for final edits and metadata adjustments.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

1. **Scalability**
   - The system should handle multiple video projects in parallel without significant performance degradation.
   - Cloud-based file storage is recommended for large PPT and video files.

2. **Performance**
   - PPT parsing should complete within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., < 60 seconds for a typical 20-slide deck).
   - Video generation can take several minutes, but users must be regularly informed of progress.

3. **Reliability & Availability**
   - The system should be available 99.9% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance windows.
   - Integrations with external AI services should handle timeouts and retries gracefully.

4. **Security & Compliance**
   - All user data (including PPT files and generated content) must be protected in transit and at rest (e.g., HTTPS, encryption at rest).
   - Access control must ensure that only authorized users can view or edit their own projects.

5. **Usability**
   - The user interface should be intuitive, guiding users step-by-step through the process.
   - Provide help text/tooltips for complex actions (e.g., AI parameters, translation options).

6. **Maintainability**
   - The system architecture should allow for easy updates to AI components (e.g., switching LLM models, updating avatar services, etc.).
   - The codebase should be clearly organized and well documented.

## 6. User Flows

### 6.1 Main Flow

1. **Login**
   - The user logs in and is directed to the Project List page.

2. **Start New Project**
   - The user clicks “New Project” or “Upload PPT.”
   - The user uploads a .PPT or .PPTX file.

3. **Parsing PPT**
   - The system processes the file, extracts slides, and stores images and text.
   - The AI suggests a project title and description.

4. **Metadata Review**
   - The user sees the suggested title/description.
   - The user can edit them or accept defaults.
   - The user picks a video template.

5. **Generate Video**
   - The user clicks “Generate.”
   - The system uses an LLM to create narratives for each slide, including transitional phrases.
   - The AI avatar service creates the narrated segments and merges them.

6. **Video Generation in Progress**
   - The user sees progress feedback.
   - The status updates change from “In Progress” to “Completed.”

7. **View Project / Playback Video**
   - Once complete, the system shows the finished video in the Project List and/or detailed view.
   - The user can play the video.

8. **Editing Slides**
   - The user can edit each slide’s text, re-generate if needed, or perform additional actions (delete, translate).

### 6.2 Alternate Flows

- **Translation Flow**
  1. The user selects “Translate” from project actions.
  2. The user chooses a language.
  3. The system re-generates narrations in the chosen language and re-renders the video.

- **Error Handling**
  1. If PPT parsing fails, the user sees an error message and can retry or upload a different file.
  2. If AI generation fails, the user is notified and can retry generation.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

1. **Functional Completeness**
   - All steps in the main flow are implementable end-to-end without manual intervention.
   - Title and description are successfully auto-generated and editable.

2. **Video Generation**
   - The system can reliably produce a video for a standard PPT deck (e.g., 10-20 slides) in under 10 minutes.
   - Narrations match the slide content, including transitions.

3. **User Edit Features**
   - The user can change the narrative text per slide and see the new version in the re-generated video.

4. **Stability & Error Resilience**
   - Common user errors (e.g., uploading a non-PPT file) display clear error messages.
   - Network or AI-service timeouts are handled gracefully with a retry mechanism.

## 8. Dependencies and Constraints

1. **External AI Services**
   - LLM for narrative generation (e.g., GPT-based API).
   - Avatar and TTS service (e.g., Synthesia or similar).
   - Potential translation service (e.g., Google Translate API, Azure Translate).

2. **File Conversion Tools**
   - Libraries or services required to parse PPT/PPTX files and generate slide images.

3. **Hosting and Storage**
   - Requires a file storage solution capable of handling large PPT and video files.
   - A database to store project and slide metadata.

4. **Supported Browsers**
   - The web application should support current versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

---

## 9. Out of Scope

- **Deep Custom Video Editing** (e.g., timeline-based advanced editing, custom transitions beyond simple fade/slide).
- **Multi-user Collaboration** on the same project in real time.
- **Advanced Branding Options** (e.g., logo overlays, color schemes, etc.) beyond basic template selection.
- **Offline Use** – The system is entirely web-based.

---

## 10. Future Enhancements (Potential)

- **Analytics & Engagement:** Track video view counts, watch times, etc.
- **Automatic Summaries:** Additional AI features to summarize or highlight key points.
- **Advanced Custom Transitions:** More sophisticated transitions or animations.
- **Full PPT Animations Support:** Importing and preserving native PPT transitions or animations.

## 11. Conclusion

This PRD outlines the **functional requirements** for a web application that transforms PowerPoint presentations into entertaining, AI-narrated videos. It specifies the user flow from uploading a PPT to editing the final generated video. These requirements focus on ensuring a smooth user experience, robust PPT parsing, intuitive editing features, and reliable AI integrations for narration and avatar generation.

A separate **Architecture Document** will detail the underlying technical design, system architecture, data models, APIs, and infrastructure considerations to implement this product effectively.
